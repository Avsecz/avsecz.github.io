I'm Å½iga Avsec, a PhD Student in the field of Computational Biology at the Technical University of Munich. I'm very passionate about everything related to data science: statistics, deep learning, data visualization, R / Python programming, *etc*. I will try to provide useful content for data scientists on this blog.
